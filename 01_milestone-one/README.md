# Milestone Project One

This project showcases music and video for the 1960's rockband The Monkees.

The application includes links to their social media profiles including YouTube and Instagram and provides features and
styling that aims to blend past and present and be a welcome source of information for followers of the band, both new and old
alike. Users can also submit a form to book their own event and stay updated for current events and concerts happening around the 
globe with a dedicated events page.


## UX
 
The project is focused on providing a media rich experience to enthusiasts and followers of the band while providing users with
useful resources such as event booking and access to social media to provide a more informative experience.

Take for example the following user story, and how this project fulfills the goals of the user;

### User Story

User A is a lifelong follower of several of the 60's decade rock bands, including The Monkees. He is interested
in being able to view tour dates and venues that he may be able to attend and also to have information on where
he can manage booking online. In addition he would like to be able to view some of the classic media sources such as
tracks he listened to growing up but is also interested in more relevant information about the band such as where
they can be found on social media and view any recent images of band members or concerts for his own interest.

**How the Project Fulfills User A's Goals**

This application is designed to reflect a 60's decade theme, while also providing features such as an events page 
where User A can view upcoming concerts and venues with links provided to book online if needed. The website also
contains several of the classic tracks from the band that User A can listen to without leaving the site but links
are also provided on each page via the footer to each main social media profile for the band allowing User A to 
connect with these networks from the website if needed. Finally the gallery hosts several new and classic images
from both albums and concerts that User A can view. 

The following resources are also available as part of the UX process for this project;
