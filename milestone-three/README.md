# Milestone Three Project

## Project Description

This project is a mythology based game where users are presented with a selection of images and must correctly identify the
name of the god being displayed, if so they score 100 points otherwise they are prompted to try again. Users can choose their own game 
pathway from either Greek, Norse or Celtic mythology and the images displayed will be from each mythology chosen. 

The development of this project has utilised the flask framework along with python 3 and a Start Bootstrap template aptly called Heroic Features
to bring together the components of the project into a functioning website. The project was then deployed
using the heroku platform.

The project contains the following page templates used with the flask application followed by a description given below;
1. **login.html** - The login page accept user logins via a form submission of their username which is then added to users.txt and scores.txt.
2. **index.html** - The home page with a welcome banner to the user who has logged in and each game path available.

5. **celtic.html** - This is the celtic mythology game path with gods from the celtic pantheon.
6. **about.html** - A description of the website is displayed along with links to each game path.
7. **leaderboards.html** - This page shows each user and their score presented in a table.
8. **contact.html** - A contact form with fields which a user can submit.
